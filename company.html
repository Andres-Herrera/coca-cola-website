        <h2>The Coca-Cola Company</h2>



        <p>
          <b>The Coca-Cola Company</b>, which is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is an American multinational beverage corporation, and manufacturer, retailer, and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups. The company is best known for its flagship product Coca-Cola, invented in 1886 by pharmacist <i>John Stith Pemberton</i> in Columbus, Georgia. The Coca-Cola formula and brand were bought in 1889 by Asa Griggs Candler (December 30, 1851 – March 12, 1929), who incorporated The Coca-Cola Company in 1892. The company has operated a franchised distribution system since 1889, wherein The Coca-Cola Company only produces syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold exclusive territories. The Coca-Cola Company owns its anchor bottler in North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments.

        </p>


        <h2>Acquisitions</h2>
        <p>
          The company has a long history of acquisitions. Coca-Cola acquired Minute Maid in 1960, the Indian cola brand Thums Up in 1993, and Barq's in 1995. In 2001, it acquired the Odwalla brand of fruit juices, smoothies, and bars for $181 million. In 2007, it acquired Fuze Beverage from founder Lance Collins and Castanea Partners for an estimated $250 million. The company's 2009 bid to buy a Chinese juice maker ended when China rejected its $2.4 billion bid for the <i>Huiyuan Juice Group</i>, on the grounds the resulting company would be a virtual monopoly. Nationalism was also thought to be a reason for aborting the deal. In 1982, Coca-Cola purchased Columbia Pictures for $692 million. It sold the movie studio to Sony, for $3 billion, in 1989. In 2013, Coca-Cola finalized its purchase of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZICO_(beverage)" target=new>ZICO</a>, a coconut water company. In 2015, the company took a minority stake ownership in the cold pressed juice manufacturer, Suja Life LLC.

        <h2>Revenue</h2>

        <p>
          According to The Coca-Cola Company's 2005 Annual Report, the firm sells beverage products in more than 200 countries. The report further states that of the more than 50 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide, daily, beverages bearing the trademarks owned by or licensed to Coca-Cola account for approximately 1.5 billion (the latest figure in 2010 shows that now they serve 1.6 billion drinks every day). Of these, beverages bearing the trademark <i>"Coca-Cola"</i> or <i>"Coke"</i> accounted for approximately 78% of the company's total gallon sales.

          Also, according to the 2007 Annual Report, Coca-Cola had gallon sales distributed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>43% in the United States</b></li>
          <li><b>37% in Mexico, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Japan, and the People's Republic of China</b></li>
          <li><b>20% spread throughout the rest of the world</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In 2010, it was announced that Coca-Cola had become the first brand to top £1 billion in annual UK grocery sales

        </p>

        <h2>Stock</h2>

        <p>
          Since 1920, Coca-Cola has been a publicly traded company. One share of stock purchased in 1919 for $40, with all dividends reinvested, would be worth $9.8 million in 2012, a 10.7% annual increase, adjusted for inflation. In 1987, Coca-Cola once again became one of the 30 stocks which makes up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is commonly referenced as a proxy for stock market performance; it had previously been a Dow stock from 1932 to 1935. Coca-Cola has paid a dividend, increasing each year for 49 years. Stock is available from a direct purchase program, through Computershare Trust Company, but unlike many programs, has investment fees
